# DareDrop Challenge - Dare2Stream

Real-time streamers voting application.
Each user has one vote per streamer. This authentication has been implemented using local storage with generated id set when opening the home page. Users can add their favorite streamer.
Socket.IO has been used to display real-time data like voting or adding the new streamer. When clicking on the streamerâ€™s name on the list, their page will be open.
